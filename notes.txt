from Visual Studio errors:

- TCHAR is wide char so use with std::wstring. and prepend any literal strings with L (if a param is LPCWSTR).

- can't do something like "TCHAR str[someLength]". dynamic sizes are unacceptable. have to use new and delete. (g++ seems to be ok with it though)

- windows.h already pulls in min and max (no need to use std::min/max from <algorithm>)

- don't use std::localtime, use localtime_s instead (got an error about it) - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38034033/c-localtime-this-function-or-variable-may-be-unsafe

- oddly(?), I had to increase the height of my comboboxes when using widechars in order for all the options to show. wonder if it is because of the widechars?

TODO:
- take resizeBMP function in capture.cpp and move the caption-writing functionality to the image capturing step? or use it
  after all the images have been taken.
- rename/replace anywhere gif is used since we won't be dealing with gifs here. maybe change it to captureFrames?
- improve status updates in gui when processing.
- be able to just pick a time duration in seconds to record. (but what to do about frame rate?)
- cleanup files if needed
- apply filter and caption

- yuv420 is important (for windows at least lol)
